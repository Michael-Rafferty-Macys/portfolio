				<p>
					My name is Michael Rafferty and I am enrolled in a Software Engineering Certification program at <strong>Thinkful</strong>.
					I had not envisioned going back to school because it seemed cost prohibitive (isn't everything nowadays).
					A new benefit from my employer made it possible to take advantage of this opportunity, for which I am quite grateful.
					This Portfolio page is a project for my program. It might evolve over time. We will see.
				</p>

				<p>
					Why did decide to enroll in the Software Engineering Certification program? I had been a coder for many years and due to changing job responsibilities
					I have not had much opportunity to code for many years. The technology progressed but my skills have not kept pace. This seemed the best way to get back
					into coding. I am looking forward to coding on a regular basis again.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I live in Huntsville, Alabama: <strong>the Rocket City</strong>. Why is Huntsville called the Rocket city? There are several reasons:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Dr. Wernher von Braun and his team set up their development facilities in Huntsville, Alabama.
			</li>
			<li>
				Huntsville, Alabama is where rockets were developed that put men on the moon.
			</li>
			<li>
				Huntsville, Alabama is the home of the <a href="https://www.rocketcenter.com/" target="_blank">U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center; the largest space museum in the world</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			When I am not working or studying, I spend time with <strong>my family</strong> and <em>my parish family at <a href="https://holyspirithsv.com/" target="_blank">Holy Spirit Catholic Church</a> in Huntsville</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am involved in several things at church:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Singing in the Chancel Choir
				</li>
				<li>
					Singing at funerals
				</li>
				<li>
					Knights of Columbus Council 764
